                    <p>Women&&Tech was launched in 2012 to feature interviews with different women working in the tech industry. I became familiar with them when I was invited to be one of the interviewees! A few years later, I joined the team and helped with the relaunch of the site as the front-end architect.</p>

                    <p>After coming back from teaching a JavaScript workshop, I felt inspired to create something just for fun. I realized that of all the content/lorem ipsum generators available, there was nothing for HBOâ€™s The Wire fans. I searched for <a href="http://thewireipsum.com" target="_blank">thewireipsum.com</a> domain and it was available! Generate some content for your projects today.</p>
